#### Old Projects
- Interstellar Invasion
    - Side Scroller Flash game on Kongregate. Unfortunately no longer live. Not sure why I deleted it :/
- Snake Snake
    - Snake clone for iPhone. I created this in my Advanced Topics class in highschool. It was legendary but is no longer playable. This class was essentially the pilot for [Make School](https://www.makeschool.com/).
- Bazooka Man
    - I created an animated bazooka man that walked and fired rockets in Java. All the movement was hardcoded. It was an epic, messy tangle that brought such a smile to my face. Unfortunately this code (and all my beautiful Java code from highschool) has been lost to time.
